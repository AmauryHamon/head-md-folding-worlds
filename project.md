## Pitch
In this garden of petrified entities turned flat and rectilign, your gaze is the key to reverse their shape back into their initial form. What was once full of voluptuous curves and fluid structures is now conquered by normative spaces. Flat plans and rigid grids allover. Pay attention to your surroundings and focus on the specific individual you want to liberate in order to mold them back into their original shape. But beware to those left unattended. Turning a blind eye is an act of surrender to the ever-constructing euclidian spaces. This is a permanent fight for you to reclaim the garden back in its hyperbolic state.

## Synopsis
This is a "1 pager" that explains all the basics in one page. This is a text-based description of the project with maybe one illustration that accompagnies the text.



## Visual Interaction Loop
Look at the flat shapes in your field of view to depetrify them into fluid moving shapes. When a static 2D shape is targeted, a timer starts to deform progressively its shape into 3D. Once fully deformed, the 3D shapes stay animated for a time, so you can focus on others. After some time, the deformed sculptures will get back to their original states, unless you've watched them long enough to permanently unlock their final level of transformation.

## POV
