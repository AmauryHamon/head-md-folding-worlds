# Hyperbolic nature

Trapped in an euclidian world, hyperbolic-shaped entities try to survive. Wearing the headset means you have a role in the fight between restraining grids and organical shapes. Turn a blind eye and the rectilinearity will carry the day, or *interact with your hands and gaze* to release the non-euclidians from their constraint back in their primary environment.
