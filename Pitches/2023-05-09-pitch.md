In a world of rectilinearity, full of planar/gridded constructed euclidean spaces, the hyperbolic-shaped nature try to survive. Wearing the headset means you have a role in this. Turn a blind eye and restrain nature to lose territory, or interact with your hands and gaze to pop euclidian constructions back into non-euclidian nature, for it to claim its territory back.
