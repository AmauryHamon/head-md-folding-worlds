# Hyperbolic nature

(500 signs max description)

In a world of rectilinearity, full of planar/gridded constructed euclidean spaces, the hyperbolic-shaped nature try to survive. Wearing the headset means you have a role in this. Turning a blind eye will restrain nature and lose its territory, or *interact with your hands and gaze* to pop euclidian constructions back into non-euclidian nature, to help nature claim its territory back.
