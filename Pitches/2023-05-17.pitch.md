In this garden of petrified entities turned flat and rectilign, your gaze is the key to reverse their shape back into their initial form. What was once full of voluptuous curves and fluid structures is now conquered by normative spaces. Flat plans and rigid grids allover. Pay attention to your surroundings and focus on the specific individual you want to liberate in order to mold them back into their original shape. But beware to those left unattended. Turning a blind eye is an act of surrender to the ever-constructing euclidian spaces. This is a permanent fight for you to reclaim the garden back in its hyperbolic state.
