In this garden of petrified flora turned flat and constructed, your gaze is the key to reverse their shape to their initial form. What was once full of luxurious wilderness is now conquered by normative spaces. Flat plans and rigid grids allover. Pay attention to your surroundings and focus on the specific flora you want to liberate in order to mold them back into their natural shape. Beware to those left unattended, they will get claimed by the evergrowing normative euclidian spaces. This is a permanent fight for you to reclaim the garden in its hyperbolic fluid untouched state.
