# Scanning our plexi with Polycam
- Tricky to scan black elements (absorbs light)
- Tricky to scan transparent/translucent elements (scan through material)

As suggested by Douglas, we should scan flat unmold plexi and their molded output. We have only done a selection of those.

The molded output are super tricky to scan, too much translucency, reflection and bad lighting setup, we need to find a way to properly scan them:
- Black curtains all around 
- Spray paint a mat texture, applying fixative with floud or else, to mattify the worst colours.
