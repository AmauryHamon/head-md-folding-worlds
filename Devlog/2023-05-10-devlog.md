# Further experiments in ways to create physical world


## Planar to Spherical to Hyperbolic shapes
Sounds cool, does kind of work, but takes too much time and hard to combine with our plexishapes aesthetically
Was nice to test how tension due to different ngones affect overall shape.

## Heating Plexi

We used this time the over to benden bigger surfaces. This proved much quicker and efficient compared to heat guns.
Yet patience is needed
