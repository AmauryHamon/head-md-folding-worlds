# 2023-05-16 Devlog

We just finished our repetitions for the mapping festival. 

## Goals of the day

### Carving the table-top in a grid

No CNC slots are available due to diplomas to carve the wooden table-top so Tomi is carving with a hand-held machine the grid while Amaury focuses on iterating the ideas.

### Physical Scene prototype

Following Camille's technique for transparent items on white surface, we retried scanning super slowly around 200 images per scan, and render with raw textures, checking the Object Masking option.

Better Results

### Iterating ideas
Following Sabrina and Camille's feedbacks:
- General direction: REVERSE MEDUSA
- Iterate to define conceptual frame
    1. Interaction: ONLY ONE for now, maybe more if enough time
    2. Assets:
    3. Asset transformation states 
    4. User Point of View : What's their responsability?
- ITERATE the four previous steps until reaching ideal state 

### Iteration 1
1. Interaction
    Your gaze and how you pay attention to your surroundings is the key interaction. Focus on a shape to decrease their petrified state.
2. Assets

3. Transformation States
4. User point of view
