# 2023-05-16 Devlog

We just finished our repetitions for the mapping festival. Barely had time to sit and think on the project so far. Lot to do and define

But we did:

### Carving the table-top in a grid

As no CNC slots are available due to diplomas rush, Tomi carved with a hand-held machine the grid while Amaury focused on thinking, 3Dscanning, scene comp

### Physical Scene prototype

We have yet to find an underlying logic to assemble the 2D surfaces in the grid. 

Does the experience starts from an enclosed space that opens its way along the progression? 
Does it start in the center? on the edge? Do we move during the experience? I'd rather not so the key interaction is the gaze.

### Scanning Assets with polycam
- Initial Tests

- Better Results
Following Camille's technique for transparent items on white surface, we retried scanning super slowly around 200 images per scan, and render with raw textures, checking the Object Masking option.

- Still struggling on some
Some scans are still problematic. Unsure if its because of their color/transluscency/reflective or else.

- Export to Cinema 4D 
Sent some successful scans to Cinema4D in OBJ for test preview, cool yo

- To do next: Scans of the whole physical scene

### Iterating ideas
Following Sabrina and Camille's feedbacks:
- General direction: REVERSE MEDUSA
- Iterate to define conceptual frame
    1. Interaction: ONLY ONE for now, maybe more if enough time
    2. Assets:
    3. Asset transformation states 
    4. User Point of View : What's their responsability?
- ITERATE the four previous steps until reaching ideal state 

### Iteration 1
1. Interaction
    Your gaze and how you pay attention to your surroundings is the key interaction. Focus on a shape to decrease their petrified state.
2. Assets

3. Transformation States
4. User point of view
