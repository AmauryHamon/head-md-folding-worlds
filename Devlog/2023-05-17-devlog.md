# ITERATION 2

1. Interaction
    - Gaze: User's field of view
    - Hands combined to gaze (optional)
        - Hands masking eyes (RESET SCENE)
        - Hands Binoculars (ZOOM OR FOCUS SINGLE ASSET by reducing field of view)
2. Assets
    - euclidian and non-euclidian shapes from the scans of the original PET plates and the thermoformed ones
3. Transformation
    - when entering the scene only euclidian shapes which will morph into non-euclidian shapes when *Interaction* occures
4. Point of view User
    - centered in the middle of the scene, static

to define: will the world fatally return to the euclidian form or is there a way to win against it?
