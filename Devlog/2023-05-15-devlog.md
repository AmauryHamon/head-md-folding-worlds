# Reverse Medusa

In the end our project can be synthesized as a Reverse Medusa, where the user's gaze/ interaction turn petrified/structured elements back into fluid and organical entities. 

## For reference, the Story of Medusa
### in antiquity

*Perseus with the Head of Medusa (1554), Benvenuto Cellini*

- one of the three monstrous Gorgons
- described as winged human females with living venomous snakes in place of hair
- Those who gazed into her eyes would turn to stone. 
- Beheaded by Greek hero Perseus, who then used her head, which retained its ability to turn onlookers to stone, as a weapon
- In classical antiquity, the image of the head of Medusa appeared in the evil-averting device known as the Gorgoneion.
- she lived and died on Sarpedon

### contemporary use
- in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage. 
- Through many of her iterations, Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male, Perseus, at its center, blameless and heroic.

For now we have:
- A surface/landscape
- 2D plexi that we can shape into 3D fluid sculptures

# Landscape grid
- To display our assets, we are planning to setup a flat wooden surface with a modular grid of enclosures CNC-ed. This will help to plug our plexi items both melted and flat. It will needs to take multiple fits depending on the plexi.
Below an example of how shapes could be plugged on it:

The school's janitor found us a discarded tabletop ready to be CNC-ed and we are planning to book a slot tomorrow. Below the table

# Feedbacks Camille
- Attention à ne pas être trop contraint par les chutes mais d'avoir une marge de manoeuvre
- Qui est l'user? Pourquoi ca fait sens qu'on libère les formes, quelles sont les clés de lecture sur ce qu'on peut faire et comment?

# Feedbacks Sabrina
- Direction Generale: REVERSE MEDUSA
- Méthodolgie pour cadrer le projet: à faire direct
    1. Interaction: UNE SEULE pour commencer, si y'a le time maybe plus
    2. Assets:
    3. Transformation d'Assets:
    4. Point de vue
- Faire des itérations sur l'étape précédente jusqu'à être méga clair
