# Reverse Medusa

In the end our project can be synthesized as a Reverse Medusa, where the user's gaze/ interaction turn petrified/structured elements back into fluid and organical entities.

## For reference, the Story of Medusa
### in antiquity

- one of the three Gorgons
- Lives in a garden of sculptures -> living ones turned to stone
- described as winged human female with living venomous snakes in place of hair
- Those who gazed into her eyes would turn to stone. 
- Beheaded by Greek hero Perseus, who then used her head, which retained its ability to turn onlookers to stone, as a weapon
- In classical antiquity, the image of the head of Medusa appeared in the evil-averting device known as the Gorgoneion.
- she lived and died on Sarpedon

### contemporary use
- in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage. 
- Through many of her iterations, Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male, Perseus, at its center, blameless and heroic.

### Feminist use of Medusa
- *The Laugh of the Medusa*, Hélène Cixous
    call to arms, urging women to reclaim their identity through writing as she rejects the patriarchal society of Western culture. Cixous wants to destroy the phallogocentric system, and to empower women's bodies and language. "You only have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her," writes Cixous. "And she's not deadly. She's beautiful and she's laughing."


# Landscape grid
- To display our assets, we are planning to setup a flat wooden surface with a modular grid of enclosures CNC-ed. This will help to plug our plexi items both melted and flat. It will needs to take multiple fits depending on the plexi.
Below an example of how shapes could be plugged on it:

The school's janitor found us a discarded tabletop ready to be CNC-ed and we are planning to book a slot tomorrow. Below the table

# Feedbacks Camille
- Don't stay too constrained by the shape of discarded plexi – keep a sense of control
- Who is the user?
- Why does it make sense to liberate the restrained shapes into organical freed shapes
- What are the takeaways of what we can do in this experience and HOW?

# Feedbacks Sabrina
- General direction: REVERSE MEDUSA
- Méthodology to define frame
    1. Interaction: ONLY ONE for now, maybe more if enough time
    2. Assets:
    3. Asset transformation states 
    4. User Point of View : What's their responsability?
- ITERATE the four previous steps until reaching ideal state
