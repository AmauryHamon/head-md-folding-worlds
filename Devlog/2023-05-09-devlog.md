## Ways to create physical world
- Heat plexiglass into organic landscape and natural elements
Below are first tests with discarded plexi samples from the workshop. After discussing with Sergio, we use both thermic heat guns but this proves quite a slow process. Another option would be to wait tomorrow morning to use the oven and heat a full plate of plexiglass to have better control of the shape and a much more efficient process.

- Lasercut pentagons, hexagons, eptagons to assemble shapes
This is also planned for tomorrow morning, we went today to lasercut the three different shapes in order to tests assembling. I guess we'll glue those while the oven cook our plexi
